## User Stories

| User Story: | Developer Expectations: | Acceptance Tests: |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Have an easy to use menu to navigate the program.| Have a welcoming message and clear directions on how to navigate the menu before playing the game.| User has multiple options upon loading the program such as Play game, Rules, About us, Exit. |
| I want to see how quickly I typed my answer. | A timer feature to calculate how long it took for the user to enter their answer. | A class and time keeping functions built to accurately calculate time spent typing the user input. |
| I want to know how high I scored while playing the game. | Add score keeping functionality that displays the users score as they play. | Program keeps track of the user's score based on their typing performance. Shows the user how many points they got. |
| I want a different sentence to type out as my challenge. | Utilize Faker python library to import randomly generated sentences as the challenges. | Faker works and we parse the data, then present this as the sentence to have the user type out. |
| I want a challenge, give me a limited amount of tries before I "lose" the game and have to retry. | Add failure conditions and keep track of the amount of fails vs tries given to the user. | The user gets a limited amount of tries based on the amount of time they took to type the message. If they cant type it within the time the tries count goes down. After there are no more tries they get a "Game Over, Try Again" message. |
